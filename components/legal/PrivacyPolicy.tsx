                and to personalise your shopping experience with us; nothing

                Whenever you use our website, or any other website, the computer
                on which the web pages are stored (the Web server) needs to know
                the network address of your computer so that it can send the
                requested web pages to your Internet browser. The unique network
                address of your computer is called its “IP address,” and is sent
                automatically each time you access any Internet site. From a
                computer’s IP address, it is possible to determine the general
                geographic location of that computer, but otherwise it is
                anonymous.

                We do not keep a record of the IP addresses from which users
                access our site except where you have specifically provided us
                with information about yourself, in which case we also record
                your IP address for security purposes. An example of this would
                be when proceeding to a checkout to finalise an order you may
                wish to make. After completing the form provided, your IP
                address will be stored along with a transaction number that
                allows us to track your order.
